defmodule ChromicPDF do
  @moduledoc """
  ChromicPDF is a fast HTML-to-PDF/A renderer based on Chrome & Ghostscript.

  ## Usage

  ### Start

  Start ChromicPDF as part of your supervision tree:

      def MyApp.Application do
        def start(_type, _args) do
          children = [
            # other apps...
            {ChromicPDF, chromic_pdf_opts()}
          ]

          Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor)
        end

        defp chromic_pdf_opts do
          []
        end
      end

  ### Print a PDF or PDF/A

      ChromicPDF.print_to_pdf({:url, "file:///example.html"}, output: "output.pdf")

  See `ChromicPDF.print_to_pdf/2` and `ChromicPDF.convert_to_pdfa/2`.

  ## Worker pools

  ChromicPDF spawns two worker pools, the session pool and the ghostscript pool. By default, it
  will create as many sessions (browser tabs) as schedulers are online, and allow the same number
  of concurrent Ghostscript processes to run.

  ### Concurrency

  To increase or limit the number of concurrent workers, you can pass pool configuration to the
  supervisor. Please note that these are non-queueing worker pools. If you intend to max them out,
  you will need a job queue as well.

      defp chromic_pdf_opts do
        [
          session_pool: [size: 3]
          ghostscript_pool: [size: 10]
        ]
      end

  ### Automatic session restarts to avoid memory drain

  By default, ChromicPDF will restart sessions within the Chrome process after 1000 operations.
  This helps to prevent infinite growth in Chrome's memory consumption. The "max age" of a session
  can be configured with the `:max_session_uses` option.

      defp chromic_pdf_opts do
        [max_session_uses: 1000]
      end

  ## Security Considerations

  Before adding a browser to your application's (perhaps already long) list of dependencies, you
  may want consider the security hints below.

  ### Escape user-supplied data

  Make sure to escape any user-provided data with something like [`Phoenix.HTML.html_escape`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_html/Phoenix.HTML.html#html_escape/1).
  Chrome is designed to make displaying HTML pages relatively safe, in terms of preventing
  undesired access of a page to the host operating system. However, the attack surface of your
  application is still increased. Running this in a containerized application with a small RPC
  interface creates an additional barrier (and has other benefits).

  ### Running in offline mode

  For some apparent security bonus, browser targets can be spawned in "offline mode" (using the
  DevTools command [`Network.emulateNetworkConditions`](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Network#method-emulateNetworkConditions).
  Chrome targets with network conditions set to `offline` can't resolve any external URLs (e.g.
  `https://`), neither entered as navigation URL nor contained within the HTML body.

      def chromic_pdf_opts do
        [offline: true]
      end

  ### Chrome Sandbox

  By default, ChromicPDF will run Chrome targets in a sandboxed OS process. If you absolutely
  must run Chrome as root, you can turn of its sandbox by passing the `no_sandbox: true` option.

      defp chromic_pdf_opts do
        [no_sandbox: true]
      end

  ## Chrome zombies

  > Help, a Chrome army tries to take over my memory!

  ChromicPDF tries its best to gracefully close the external Chrome process when its supervisor
  is terminated. Unfortunately, when the BEAM is not shutdown gracefully, Chrome processes will
  keep running.  While in a containerized production environment this is unlikely to be of
  concern, in development it can lead to unpleasant performance degradation of your operation
  system.

  In particular, the BEAM is not shutdown properlyâ€¦

  * when you exit your application or `iex` console with the Ctrl+C abort mechanism (see issue [#56](https://github.com/bitcrowd/chromic_pdf/issues/56)),
  * and when you run your tests. No, after an ExUnit run your application's supervisor is
    not terminated cleanly.

  There are a few ways to mitigate this issue.

  ### "On Demand" mode

  In case you habitually end your development server with Ctrl+C, you should consider enabling "On
  Demand" mode which disables the session pool, and instead starts and stops Chrome instances as
  needed. If multiple PDF operations are requested simultaneously, multiple Chrome processes will
  be launched (each with a pool size of 1, disregarding the pool configuration).

      defp chromic_pdf_opts do
        [on_demand: true]
      end

  To enable it only for development, you can load the option from the application environment.

      # config/config.exs
      config :my_app, ChromicPDF, on_demand: false

      # config/dev.exs
      config :my_app, ChromicPDF, on_demand: true

      # application.ex
      @chromic_pdf_opts Application.compile_env!(:my_app, ChromicPDF)
      defp chromic_pdf_opts do
        @chromic_pdf_opts ++ [... other opts ...]
      end

  ### Terminating your supervisor after your test suite

  You can enable "On Demand" mode for your tests, as well. However, please be aware that each
  test that prints a PDF will have an increased runtime (plus about 0.5s) due to the added Chrome
  boot time cost. Luckily, ExUnit provides a [method](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.html#after_suite/1)
  to run code at the end of your test suite.

      # test/test_helper.exs
      ExUnit.after_suite(fn _ -> Supervisor.stop(MyApp.Supervisor) end)
      ExUnit.start()

  ### Only start ChromicPDF in production

  The easiest way to prevent Chrome from spawning in development is to only run ChromicPDF in
  the `prod` environment. However, obviously you won't be able to print PDFs in development or
  test then.

  ## Debugging Chrome errors

  Chrome's stderr logging is silently discarded to not obscure your logfiles. In case you would
  like to take a peek, add the `discard_stderr: false` option.

      defp chromic_pdf_opts do
        [discard_stderr: false]
      end

  ## Telemetry support

  To provide insights into PDF and PDF/A generation performance, ChromicPDF executes the
  following telemetry events:

  * `[:chromic_pdf, :print_to_pdf, :start | :stop | exception]`
  * `[:chromic_pdf, :capture_screenshot, :start | :stop | :exception]`
  * `[:chromic_pdf, :convert_to_pdfa, :start | :stop | exception]`

  Please see [`:telemetry.span/3`](https://hexdocs.pm/telemetry/telemetry.html#span-3) for
  details on their payloads, and [`:telemetry.attach/4`](https://hexdocs.pm/telemetry/telemetry.html#attach-4)
  for how to attach to them.

  Each of the corresponding functions accepts a `telemetry_metadata` option which is passed to
  the attached event handler. This can, for instance, be used to mark events with custom tags such
  as the type of the print document.

      ChromicPDF.print_to_pdf(..., telemetry_metadata: %{template: "invoice"})

  The `print_to_pdfa` function emits both the `print_to_pdf` and `convert_to_pdfa` event series,
  in that order.

  ## How it works

  ### PDF Printing

  * ChromicPDF spawns an instance of Chromium/Chrome (an OS process) and connects to its
    "DevTools" channel via file descriptors.
  * The Chrome process is supervised and the connected processes will automatically recover if it
    crashes.
  * A number of "targets" in Chrome are spawned, 1 per worker process in the `SessionPool`. By
    default, ChromicPDF will spawn each session in a new browser context (i.e., a profile).
  * When a PDF print is requested, a session will instruct its assigned "target" to navigate to
    the given URL, then wait until it receives a "frameStoppedLoading" event, and proceed to call
    the `printToPDF` function.
  * The printed PDF will be sent to the session as Base64 encoded chunks.

  ### PDF/A Conversion

  * To convert a PDF to a PDF/A-3, ChromicPDF uses the [ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/)
    utility.
  * Since it is required to embed a color scheme into PDF/A files, ChromicPDF ships with a copy
    of the royalty-free [`eciRGB_V2`](http://www.eci.org/) scheme by the European Color
    Initiative. If you need to be able a different color scheme, please open an issue.
